## AI-powered CSV analysis tool for instant insights

### Made for nwHacks 2025 hackathon

Data Dave makes data analysis accessible through a chat-based interface. Upload your CSV file and get instant insights and visualizations without needing to know coding or Excel functions.

The tool uses a fine-tuned function calling system to figure out what kind of analysis you're asking for. We put a lot of work into optimizing how data gets fed to the LLM to prevent context loss, which keeps the analysis accurate even with larger datasets.

You can also ask for visualizations in natural language and tweak them through follow-up messages. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, the backend runs on Flask, and the two communicate over WebSocket. Assistant responses render as Markdown for clean formatting.
