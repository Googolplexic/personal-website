## My first actual project

A web-based tool that helps users mark fractions on square paper using origami folding techniques. Users can input any fraction, and the application will generate visual step-by-step folding sequences.

It currently supports two folding methods: the Crossing Diagonals method and Fujimoto's Construction method. The sequences are dynamically generated for each fraction, with automatic simplification, step-by-step navigation, and input validation. There's some mobile responsiveness too.

As this was my first time working with web development, this doubled as a learning project. I learned a lot about SVG, JavaScript, and CSS during the development process. I also learned how to structure a project and manage its dependencies.
