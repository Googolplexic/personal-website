## VS Code extension for previewing and visualizing FOLD format files

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides comprehensive support for working with FOLD (Flexible Origami List Datastructure) files. It features an interactive preview window and enhanced editing capabilities.

### Preview

The extension gives you a real-time visualization of FOLD files with pan and zoom, full-window canvas support, and auto-updates when you change the file. You can customize how mountain, valley, and boundary folds look, toggle vertex display, and adjust color schemes and line styles. There's also a labeling system for vertices, edges, and faces with indexed labels that scale dynamically with zoom.

### Editor Integration

FOLD files get syntax highlighting, JSON formatting with customizable indentation, and format-on-save support. There's also a custom file icon, bracket matching, and auto-closing pairs.

### Customization

Pretty much everything is configurable through VS Code's settings UI: fold colors and styles, label appearance, canvas properties, line styles, and vertex display.

The extension is available on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ColemanLai.fold-preview)!
